    "prompt1": "Let's mix Magic: The Gathering with Uno. Players can play Magic cards from their hand, but they can also play Uno cards to disrupt their opponents' plans. For example, if someone is about to attack with a powerful creature, a player could play an Undo card to set things back to their previous state. If someone lands a critical hit with a spell or attack, a Block card could cancel out the damage."
