# metatron3

The third iteration of my machine learning discord bot that uses the avernus API server

# Features:

![](/assets/readme/slash_commands.png)

## Chatbot:

Simply tag the bot with its name to interact with it. It keeps a per user history 
of the users conversation with it but cannot otherwise see chat.

The LLM model which is used can be configured in configs/avernus.json. It takes
huggingface repo names. Note that the first time a model is used (such as the first run)
there will be a large delay while the avernus server downloads the model.

## /sdxl_gen:

This generates an image with the sdxl model specified in configs/avernus.json

- prompt: Is your prompt
- negative_prompt: The generated image will move away from this. Useful to avoid unwanted things in gens.
- width: The width in pixels of the image to generate. Defaults to 1024 Be careful of setting this too high as itll require more video memory and over a certain point cause deformed generations.
- height: Same as above but tall style
- batch_size: The number of images to generate at once. Combined with image resolution this can have a direct and large effect on video memory usage. If you are having lots of avernus Out Of Memory issues, try decreasing batch size and/or resolution
- lora_name: this is the filename(including safetensors extesion) of a lora located in appropriate avernus server lora directory.

## /flux_gen

This generates an image using the flux.dev model, which is higher quality than sdxl but slower and takes more memory while running.

- prompt: Is your prompt
- width: The width in pixels of the image to generate. Defaults to 1024 Be careful of setting this too high as itll require more video memory and over a certain point cause deformed generations.
- height: Same as above but tall style
- batch_size: The number of images to generate at once. Combined with image resolution this can have a direct and large effect on video memory usage. If you are having lots of avernus Out Of Memory issues, try decreasing batch size and/or resolution

## /mtg_gen

This generates a satire magic card based on the users prompt using a combination of the chosen sdxl model, as well as the llm specified at "mtg_llm_model" in configs/avernus.json. 

It will include the discord server icon as a set icon, a random artist for the artist name, and the user name and server name for the copyright. 

THESE ARE SATIRE CARDS AND NOT MEANT TO BE USED COMMERCIALLY.

## /mtg_gen_three_pack

Same as above but generates three at a time, which is also what is triggered if twitch integration is enabled and the appropriate channel reward triggered.
